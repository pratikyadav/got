```
Here is Westeros and Essos as vectorbased Shapefiles (.shp), made by me with QGIS.

The map is based on theMountainGoats map, so the parts except Westeros and the area around the Slaver's Bay and Gulf of Grief are speculative.
Being based on theMountainGoats map, this one is also licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.

The files contain the shapes and names of the continents, islands, rivers, lakes, roads, cities, some regions and the political borders from the beginning of the first book.

The Screenshots shows the data with some styles added, surely not the best you can do, but gives an impression on the data.
Have fun using it.
